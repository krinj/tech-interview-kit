# Tech Interview Kit
A collection of tools and exercises to prepare for technical interviews.

## Overview

* Implement data structures and algorithms.
* Implement common bit-manipulation functions.
* Develop a problem analysis protocol.
* Learn the time complexities.
* Prepare 5+ behavioral (STAR) responses.
* Data type knowledge (ASCII, UTF-8, Ints, size conversions).
* OS Knowledge (Threading, Locks, Mutex, Semaphore).
* Essential CS Math (Probability, Sums, Series, Combinatorics, N choose K, Sets).

## Building Blocks

A lot of problems are solved using data structures and algorithms. So we will start by implementing these ourselves. Here are the objectives:

* Be familiar with how to implement all the core data structure and algorithms, so that we understand them better, but also we can be confident with making modifications.
* For each data structure, we should know which algorithms can be used on it.
* For each one, we should be able to describe its purpose, complexity, advantages and disadvantages. We should be able to give examples of when they could be effective, as well as alternatives.
* For our preferred language, we should also be familiar with any implementation of these in the standard library.
